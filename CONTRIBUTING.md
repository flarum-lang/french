# How to contribute

First off, this language pack is a volunteer effort, so thanks a lot for considering contributing.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the French language pack for Flarum. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Introduction

The French language pack for Flarum is under the [MIT License](https://github.com/milescellar/flarum-ext-french/blob/master/LICENSE) and is open source, so it can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone.

If you want to directly contribute to the project, you accept to grant the project a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use your submitted code in any way. Please don't contribute with something which legally doesn't belong to you. It's prohibited by the law, contrary to the spirit of open source and the contribution will inevitably end up being removed, causing troubles. The code you wrote is your original work (meaning that you own the copyright) or you otherwise have the right to submit the work.

## Submit an issue

Firstly, ensure the issue was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/milescellar/flarum-ext-french/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, you're welcome to [open a new one](https://github.com/milescellar/flarum-ext-french/issues/new).

Be sure to include a title and a clear description, as much relevant information as possible.

Don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster replies by asking the community [on the dedicated discussion](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/615-french-language-pack).

## Submit changes

Please [send a pull request](https://github.com/milescellar/flarum-ext-french/compare) with a clear description of the issue and the solution. This is the fastest way for us to evaluate your changes and to merge them into the code base. Do not forget to include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Coding standards

- Files should be indented with two spaces, or four spaces in PHP and JSON code, with no tabs
- Lines should have no trailing whitespace at the end except for Markdown files
- Files should use Unix (LF) line endings
- Files should be encoded in UTF-8 without a BOM
- Files should end with a newline

Please note that we host an [.editorconfig](https://github.com/milescellar/flarum-ext-french/blob/master/.editorconfig) file which sets all those properties and instructs text editors to adhere to them. More information can be found at the [EditorConfig website](http://editorconfig.org/).
