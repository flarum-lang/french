## Documentation

### How to download?

Click [here] (https://github.com/maelsoucaze/flarum/archive/master.zip) or on the *Download ZIP* button in the right panel, as simple as that!

### How to install?

Once the compressed extension downloaded, you will need to extract the archive.

Using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root (which contains the config.php file). You will see an *extensions/* repository. Inside this repository, you have to create a *french/* repository. Then, upload the content of the previous extracted archive inside the *french/* repository.

Now that the extension is uploaded to your server, you will have to install it. Log-in to your forum and click on your username at the top right of the screen. You will see a pop-up, and you have to click on **Administration** link. Once in the administration page, you will have to click on *Extensions*. Then, once in the extensions page, you will see the grey tinted *French* extension, with an icon of the Earth and a blue background. Hover the extension and you will see a dotted vertical menu. Click on the vertical menu and click on *Enable*.

Your French extension is now installed. Congratulations! You and your users can select the language via a dropdown menu located in the header, at the right of the search box.

### How to update?

Once the updated compressed extension downloaded, you will need to extract the archive.

Using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root (which contains the config.php file). You have to access to your *extensions/* repository, and to the *french/* repository. Inside this repository, upload the new files by replacing the old ones.

Your French extension is now updated. But you have to clear the cache of your forum. Using [FTP] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), you will need to browse into your Flarum root and to locate the *assets/* repository. Inside the repository, you will see a *forum-fr-XYZ.js*, with XYZ as random letters and numbers. Please delete this file. That's it, enjoy the latest improvements and fixes of the updated extension!
